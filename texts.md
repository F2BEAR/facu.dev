## About Me

Hello everyone reading this. As the header implies, my name is Facundo and I'm a Front-end developer (and sometimes full-stack) from Uruguay.

I've been working for a couple of years with web technologies (since 2017), but I started studying computer science on 2013.

I like to work with technologies such as:

* React Js
* Node Js
* Express Js
* MongoDB
* Vue Js
* MySql
* Laravel

## Academic Formation

I started studying computer science on 2013 at ITI, which is an institute from UTU where I finish High Shcool with a degree of IT technician.

There I learn how to code, how to manage data bases, how to repear computers and also how to install and mantain infrastructure network.

Currently I'm still at UTU but nowadays I'm finishing a tertiary degree in Software and Networking, where I'm developing my graduation proyect.

And on 2019 I did a of React JS and React Native on Hack Academy, a well known IT academy from Uruguay.
