			<h1 className="mb-3 text-3xl">Hi there!</h1>
			<p>
				My name is Facundo and I’m a former Full-Stack web developer currently
				working at Take-off Media here on Uruguay.
			</p>
			<p>
				I started studying Computer Sciense on 2013 at UTU, which is a public
				high-school level institute where you get specialized on a certain
				carrer; there I learned basic infrastructure, networking, development
				with Java and MySQL.
			</p>
			<p>
				When I finished high-school I joined a non-univeritary tertiary degree
				of Software and Networking at UTU as well and finished it on mid 2022.
			</p>
			<p>
				On 2019 I did a 3 month bootcamp of React.JS and React Native on Hack
				Academy, a well known IT academy from Uruguay, and from there I fell in
				love with JavaScript and it’s ecosystem.
			</p>
			<p>
				On that same year I got hired at TCS as a Junior IT Technician where I
				was trained on several subjects until they found me a project to work
				on.{' '}
			</p>
			<p>
				Then on January 2020 I joined a QAT team where I did UAT for more than a
				year. I did a lot of blackbox testing, from smoke testings to
				implementation testings on deploy nights and all that’s in between.
			</p>
			<p>
				At the begining of 2021 I switched to an App Support team; there I took
				care of data fixes on the databases, deploying and maintaining clusters
				on the cloud, find errors over the logs, smoke test applications during
				deployments, etc. There I worked with technologies such as Azure DevOps,
				Splunk, Rancher, Kubernetes, Docker, MongoDB, MySQL, NodeJS, Angular,
				and many others.
			</p>
			<p>
				Then on September 2021 I left TCS to join Take-off Media as a formal web
				developer. From then I had to work on multiple projects, from
				development to maintanance, with technologies such as Node.Js, .Net, Vue
				JS, Angular, MongoDb, Docker, and many more.
